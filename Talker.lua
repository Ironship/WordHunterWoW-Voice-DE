-- The frame that shows who is talking.
--
-- Sound with nothing on screen is confusing: a voice starts, and the player has
-- no way to tell which quest it belongs to, whether it is this addon at all, or
-- how to make it stop. So while a passage is being read there is a portrait, the
-- quest's name, which sentence of how many is being spoken, and one transport
-- button in the corner -- pause while it is speaking, play when it is not.
--
-- This wore a close cross in the corner at first, which reads as "hide this
-- window" and so was never pressed to stop a voice -- and there was no way at
-- all to hear a passage a second time, which is the thing somebody learning the
-- language wants most. A pair of media-transport icons answers both without
-- putting a word of German on the frame.
--
-- It appears only while something is being read and takes no clicks otherwise,
-- so it costs a player who never notices it nothing.

-- What this window follows, and why it is a scale rather than a font size.
--
-- It followed nothing at all: a player who set the quest panel to 200% got
-- 24pt words with a fixed 300x96 talker beside them, which is one of the
-- windows the "every window a different size" complaint was pointing at.
--
-- It cannot be answered with a font size. Both strings here are SetWordWrap
-- (false) inside a frame pinned at 300 wide, with 194px of that left for the
-- quest name -- less than a real German quest name needs at 12pt already. A
-- bigger font in the same box truncates more, not less. SetScale grows the box
-- and the letters together, which is the only move that makes this frame
-- readable rather than shorter.
--
-- And no new setting: the voice side stores no size key of its own, so it
-- borrows the base addon's quest-panel text size -- the setting for the words
-- this window is captioning. With the base absent there is nothing to ask and
-- it stays at 1, the same shape the theming and the padding here already take.
