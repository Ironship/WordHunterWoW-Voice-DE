-- A play button beside every paragraph the pack has a recording for, so a
-- passage can be heard again without reopening the quest.
--
-- Drawn into QuestWordHunter's own panel, from here rather than from there.
-- That is what makes it optional in the way it has to be: a player without the
-- voice packs has this addon absent entirely, and the panel they see is the
-- panel they have always seen. Nothing in QuestWordHunter knows what a button
-- is for; it only offers a callback once its text is laid out.
--
-- A button appears only where a clip actually exists. One that plays nothing is
-- worse than none at all -- it turns "this quest has no audio yet", which is
-- true and common, into "this addon is broken".

-- What QuestWordHunter calls the passage on screen, against what the clips are
-- filed under. "gossip" has no entry: gossip text is not a quest and has no
-- recording.
local PASSAGE_FIELD = {
  offer = "description",
  progress = "progress",
  reward = "completion",
}

-- Where a button goes, and why it is no longer beside the word its clip starts
-- at.
--
-- It used to be exactly there: anchored to the left of the first word of the
-- clip's first sentence. But a clip starts where its sentence starts, and a
-- sentence starts mid-line about a third of the time -- 65% of the clips in
-- tests/_grouping_texts.txt begin a line, and the rest do not. Every one of the
-- rest had its button drawn on top of the word in front of it: "erbost[]Meine".
--
-- The trailing space at the ragged end of a line looks like the answer and is
-- not. The panel wraps a line when the next word would cross the content's
-- width, so what a line leaves behind is narrower than the word that would not
-- fit: at the panel's own default size, two clips in five start on a line with
-- under 18px to spare, and one in ten has no line anywhere in the clip with that
-- much. A place to stand that exists for nine clips in ten is not a place to
-- stand.
--
-- Nor is there a gutter to be had inside the text. QuestPanel's wordButtons loop
-- lays its tokens from x = 0 and wraps them at the full width of panel.content,
-- and that content fills the scroll frame it sits in: 8px short of it with the
-- English column on, 2px wider than it without. Every pixel of the column can
-- hold a word, so room inside it can only be made by the panel, and reflowing
-- the panel's own text is not this addon's to do.
--
-- What is left is the margin the panel already leaves outside that scroll frame,
-- between the text and its own edge. One button to a line, on the line its clip
-- starts.
local BUTTON_SIZE = 16

-- The icon sits inside the quest panel, on the line of the words it reads, and
-- that panel is the one window here that grows its letters without growing
-- itself. So a 16px icon stayed 16px beside 24pt words at 200% -- of the three
-- surfaces that followed no setting at all, this was the worst placed, because
-- everything around it did move.
--
-- It follows the panel's own text size, which is the setting for the very words
-- it is anchored to. No new setting, and nothing to ask when the base addon is
-- absent -- in which case there is no panel to draw in either.

-- the line between the two columns. That is the picture this replaces.
