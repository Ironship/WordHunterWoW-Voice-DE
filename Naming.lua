-- Every sound pack carries a copy of the engine -- these five files and the two
-- stand-in clips -- so that any one pack is a complete download and there is no
-- separate engine to install first. The client loads addons in the order of
-- their folder names, so the first pack it reaches runs its copy and writes its
-- folder here; the copies in every pack after it read the name, see it is not
-- theirs, and stop at their first lines -- each of the five files carries the
-- same two. One engine runs, whichever pack it came from, and finds every
-- pack's clips the way it always has: by the folder each pack names in Part.lua.
--
-- A stand-alone engine from before the packs carried one -- the old
-- WordHunterWoW-Voice-DE folder, if it was never removed -- loads ahead of any
-- pack by the same alphabetical rule and defines its functions without ever
-- naming a host. ForgetParts is one of them, and its presence means an engine
-- is already running, so the copies yield to that one too rather than run a
-- second engine over it.
--
-- The version is written down here rather than read from a manifest because a
-- pack's manifest carries the pack's version, which moves when clips are
-- re-read and the engine has not changed. Each copy files its own before it
-- yields, so the running engine can say when a pack carries a newer one than
-- the copy that got to run -- Settings.lua's page and /whwv both do.
